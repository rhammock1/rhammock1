### Hi there, my name is Robert Hammock ðŸ‘‹

## I am a Full-Stack Developer from Charlotte, NC and I love to use Raspberry Pi and Arduino to solve problems. 

  - Currently working as a Software Developer with [GoTab Inc.](https://gotab.io)
  - Will soon be working on a blog to share projects as they are built
  - Recently used [HyperBian](https://github.com/hyperion-project/HyperBian) to add reactive lights behind my tv

## My current side projects include: 
  - Building Raspberry Pi Zero Game Boy v3 with [RetroPie](https://retropie.org.uk/)
  - Building a continuum robotic arm to move a laser and play with my cats
  - Setting up a local computer as a home server to keep a reverse shell connection alive with AWS ec2 

## My goals for 2022:
  - Continue to learn and apply my skills
  - Complete 3 meaningful side projects
  - Read 5 books about programming
