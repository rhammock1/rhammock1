### Hi there, my name is Robert Hammock ðŸ‘‹

## I am a Full-Stack Developer from Charlotte, NC, and I love to use Raspberry Pi and Arduino to solve problems. 

  - Iâ€™m currently in the Thinkful Engineering Immersion program, and right now I am learning React

## My current side projects include: 
  - Building a react app to dynamically display sales statistics for a company called 'Freshlist'
  - Creating a follower counter for the 'Sports Biz Camps' LinkedIn page
  - Using a Raspberry Pi, openCV, and Arduino to make a robot arm wave and generate a message on a display when it recognizes someone

## My goals for the rest of 2020:
  - Network with at least 5 software developers in the Charlotte area
  - Practice what I have learned with side projects
  - Identify at least 5 companies in my area that align with my values and could be a potential employer
